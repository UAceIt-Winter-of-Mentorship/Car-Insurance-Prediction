About the project 
Car insurance offers protection against accidents, theft, natural calamities & other 
unforeseen circumstances that could harm your vehicle. Having a good motor insurance 
policy ensures that you and your car are protected from the financial losses of these 
unfortunate events.
Problem Statement
Imagine you are a data scientist at a bank in your city. Your bank besides usual services also 
provides car insurance services. The bank has potential customers data and bank employees 
call them for advertising available car insurance options. Based on previous advertisement 
campaigns, your task is to predict whether a customer will buy car insurance or not.
You are provided with general information (train data) about clients (age,job,etc.) as well as 
more specific information about the current insurance sell campaign (communication,last 
contact day) and previous campaign (attributes like previous attempts,outcome etc). 
You have data of about 3100 customers who were contacted during the last campaign and 
for whom the results of the campaign (if the customer bought insurance or not) are known.
Objective
You are provided 935 customers data (test data) who were contacted during the current 
campaign. You are required to build a machine learning model to predict if these customers 
will buy the car insurance or not.
Try to achieve maximum accuracy.
